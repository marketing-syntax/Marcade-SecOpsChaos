# Marcade-SecOpsChaos

Welcome to Sec Ops Chaos!

The first of many Mar-cade games, designed for you to have fun, learn something, and ever so slightly experience a light sales pitch (we mean lightly, finish a level and see how low-pressure it is).

Play as an intrepid security analyst working to secure the business and preserve their weekend.

Jump, dodge, and weave through increasingly difficult office based 2D environments, dodging email and chat enemies while maintaining your mental capacity health bar.

Pickup any spare coffees you find laying around, it helps a little but even a little is good.

Can you sneak out of the office on Friday at 2:30? Or does something unforeseen have other plans for you?

Sec Ops Chaos, helping security services marketing, without being obtrusive in your inbox.

*Quick notes on usability. The music is set to mute on each screen by default, just in case you're playing at work and forgot your headset. ESC will pause the game so you can resume at your leisure*
